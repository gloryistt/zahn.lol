      hi baby in case the main page ever goes down or something breaks, i still wanted there to be a place that says this plainly. i like your ugly laugh, the one that makes everything feel lighter. i like your voice, especially when you're soft with me. i like how smart you are, and how you explain things in a way that actually shifts how i see stuff. i like your advice, and the way it feels like you're sitting right next to me trying to figure things out with me. i like your insight, your humor, and the way you make even nothing conversations feel like something. just so it's written somewhere: i mean it.
